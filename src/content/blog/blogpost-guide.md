# The ultimate Guide to Blog Posts

Since I am starting my own blog I thought it appropiate to give the question 'How to write a good blog post' some thought. The correct answer to this like for many things in life is "It depends". Mainly on what you are trying to archieve, who your target audience is and what the topic of the blog post is. If you are trying to do hidden marketing you need to highlight the strengths of your product. If you are writing a technical piece you need a more scientific approach with facts, proofs of concepts and prototypes and if you are going over a political or philosophical question you need to be convincing that your answer deserves some thought. But no matter which kind of blog you are writing all have some aspects in common.

- **The Hook**
- **The Content**
- **The Conclusion**

## The Hook

No matter what you are writing, if you cannot keep you reader engaged after the first few sentences or not get him to click on your post at all you might as well shout into a pillow or talk to a brick wall. That is why both your title and first paragraph need to be on point and spark an unquenchable interest in your readers. An interest you then promise to quench. You will make the promise that after reading your post the reader will know the answer to whatever made them click in the first place. If you can deliver on this promise in an entertaining or informative fashion there is a chance they will return. If not, better luck next time.

Further if you outline how you will go about to answer this question it will let the reader create expectations and help them prime previous knowledge about the arguments. Which will create a need for validation of said knowledge or give them a chance to feel superior to you since they proof to themselves a deeper understanding of the topic then you presented. Eitherway it makes it more likely for them to read the post to the end.

This is more difficult the more basic or generic your topic is. Highly technical content might attract people with specialist knowledge just by using the technical issue discussed in the blog as a title. While the effort is lower to attract these specialist know that the audience size will be proportionally small. Generic posts will need more wild titles like _"The ultimate Guide to Blog Posts"_ to have similar or even weaker effects. You are not the only person shouting from the rooftop. Furthermore chances are higher that readers of these posts will never return, since it is generally impossible to have a trully satisfying answer to such posts. So don't sweat it too much.

I would recommend to find a niche you feel comfortable about and try to build a community with a discord server and maybe a patreon if you manage have enough followers that the fun-time blog turns into a profession. But that is another topic.

## The Content

Which brings us to another key aspect. Always stay on topic, it is hard enough to keep you readers hooked on the chosen topic so there is no space for another. What you can do is just link to another blog post where you go over the specific of a related topic or even create a series of connected post each referencing the other. Everything else needs to be trimmed.

One way to structure you post is to seperate arguments into paragraphs with the key sentence in front and facts, thought experiments or references afterwards. That way the reader has an easier time to read or skim through the text. The average brain can only take in so much at once, so lets make it convenient and do a litte _seperation of concerns_. If there are differing opinions about an argument you can mention them but either go into those in a different paragraph or give your readers a link to another source.

People love stories more then they love fact. It is a proven fact that people remember anecdotes way better than dry facts. So if you can emphasize a fact with a small story or metaphor it will give the reader a higher chance to remember and maybe reference your blog in the future. This is especially important if the topic you are discussing of subjective nature without a clear answer. The reader will be more likely agreeing with your point if you make it relatable. We are a social pack-animal after all.

For the same reason of relatability I would recommend a light hearted tone of text if the topic allows it. So try to sneak some small jokes without distracting from the main topic. Try to evade charged words and keep your sentences short. This way the reader can concentrate on the content not the presentation. If a reader gets frustrated because they need to reread a paragraph several time just to guess its meaning you can be certain they stop reading your blog post right there. A blog no matter how informative is partly read for entertainment reasons.

Further you can change the pace of your text with including images or graphs as visual aids. It allows the reader to take a breath and either take in what just was presented to them or help them get an overview about what you are getting into. Otherwise images and memes can be aimed to just get a laugh out of your reader and help them improve their mood. The more positive they feel about your blog the better and what can be nicer than a laugh.

## The Conclusion

Since peoples time and attention spans are more limited then ever do not create overly long texts. Make your point and give the reader a chance to decide for themselves if they agree or not. Bored people tend to get distracted and leave your blog after all.

The _conclusion_ should help the reader feel convinced of your statement in the hook or conviced to end the topic here and come back another day for another post. Either way it should feel like your blog post was a tighly packed information unit that belongs together. If possible there should be nothing immediate related left unmentioned.

With the promise from the hook delivered it is now your time to shine. What does the truth of your statement or the answer to the question mean? What can be _concluded_ or _derived_? How does this relate to other things? Be brave. End with a banger. This is your chance to present your opinion and form the opinion of others. This is your chance to put a piece of information into context. Think big picture.

Personally I would recommend ending with a quote or statement that sums up the message you wanted to convey. The essence of your text, this will leave your reader more satisfied.

Which concludes our blog post. I believe you can use this advice to create high quality blogs. So go out there, participate and build the web you want to be part off.
